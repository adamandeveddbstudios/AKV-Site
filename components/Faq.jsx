          Women’s Self-Help Groups (SHGs) often play a major role in harvesting,
          drying, and processing herbal plants. Shrubs like Adusa and Kanghi
          offer accessible raw materials for herbal teas, powders, oils, and
          balms. Yavasa and Chirchita are commonly used in traditional remedies
          that women can prepare and sell locally or supply to Ayurvedic firms.
          Shrubs can be grown on homestead boundaries or community plots,
          reducing the need for land ownership. Cultivating and marketing
          shrub-based herbal products helps women generate income, build local
          value chains, and promote indigenous knowledge, contributing to
          economic independence and skill development.
